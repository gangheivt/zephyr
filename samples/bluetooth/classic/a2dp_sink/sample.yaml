  name: "Classic Bluetooth A2DP Sink with AVRCP Target"  
  description: >
    This sample implements a Classic Bluetooth (BR/EDR) A2DP Sink device with 
    AVRCP Target support. It receives stereo audio from a Bluetooth Controller 
    (e.g., smartphone) via A2DP and responds to basic AVRCP commands (play/pause/stop, 
    volume up/down). BLE is disabled, only Classic Bluetooth is used for device discovery 
    and data transmission.
